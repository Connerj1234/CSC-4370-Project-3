## 📂 File Structure

### Root Files
* `index.html` – Main UI layout
* `styles.css` – App styling and themes
* `puzzle.js` – Game logic and UI behavior
* `api.js` – Frontend API helper
* `schema.sql` – Database schema and seed data

### API Folder (`/api`)
* `db.php` – PDO database connection
* `response.php` – JSON helpers
* `auth.php` – Session setup and auth middleware
* `auth/` – Register, login, logout, me
* `game/` – Start, update, and end session
* `insights/` – Progress dashboard data
* `analytics/` – Event logging

---

## 🗄 Database Design

### Setup
1.  Create a MySQL database on the school server.
2.  Import `schema.sql`.
3.  Update credentials in `api/db.php`.

```sql
SOURCE schema.sql;
````

### Key Tables

  * `users`
  * `game_sessions`
  * `puzzles`
  * `achievements`
  * `user_achievements`
  * `user_story_progress`
  * `analytics_events`

Achievements are seeded directly from SQL and awarded server-side.

-----

### 🔐 Security and Data Integrity

  * Password hashing using `password_hash` and `password_verify`
  * PDO prepared statements with emulation disabled
  * PHP session hardening
      * `session.use_strict_mode`
      * `session.cookie_httponly`
      * `session.cookie_secure` (HTTPS aware)
  * Authorization middleware (`require_login`)
  * Transaction-based session completion
  * Server-side achievement awarding
  * Uniqueness constraints to prevent duplicate achievements

-----

### 📈 Dynamic Difficulty System

  * Difficulty levels unlock sequentially
  * Performance score based on moves and time
  * Difficulty persists using `localStorage`
  * Higher difficulty reduces available magic

**Difficulty labels:**

  * Easy
  * Normal
  * Hard
  * Expert
  * Master

-----

### 🪄 Magic and Power Ups

#### Magic

  * Heuristic-based suggested move
  * Does not increment move counter
  * Usage tracked and affects achievements

#### Power Ups

  * Time Freeze: pauses timer and music
  * Swap Pass: swaps empty tile with best valid 2-away tile
  * Completion Insight: estimates remaining effort

All usage is stored per session in JSON format.

-----

### 🏆 Achievements and Rewards

Achievements are defined in the database and awarded server-side.

**Examples:**

  * First Toy Built – First win
  * Santa Speedrun – Win in 60 seconds
  * Workshop Regular – 10 wins
  * Pure Skill – Win without magic
  * Master Elf – Win on higher difficulty

Achievements cannot be duplicated or client-forced.

-----

### 📖 Christmas Story Mode

  * Story progression saved per user
  * Story stage increases every few completed puzzles
  * Max stage cap applied
  * Guest users prompted to log in

-----

### 📊 Progress Dashboard

**Displays:**

  * Total wins and sessions
  * Best time and best moves
  * Story stage and puzzles solved
  * Recent sessions table
  * Earned achievements

All data is retrieved from the backend and persisted.

-----

### 🧩 Kanban Methodology and Communication

  * Kanban-style workflow
  * Regular Discord standups (every 2 days)
  * Weekly sprint planning
  * Task ownership and collaboration via Discord

A reconstructed Kanban board was created based on completed tasks for documentation and presentation clarity.

-----

### 🧪 Development Journal Highlights

  * Database schema planning for persistence
  * Secure authentication implementation
  * Session lifecycle management
  * Fixing timer behavior (start on Shuffle only)
  * Server-side achievement logic
  * Assistance features designed to reduce frustration while preserving challenge
  * Story progression tied strictly to completed sessions

-----

### ✅ Testing Checklist

  * Timer starts only on Shuffle
  * Reset stops timer and clears board
  * Only legal tile moves allowed
  * Move counter increments correctly
  * Session saves on completion
  * Achievements awarded once
  * Difficulty progression enforced
  * Progress persists across refresh and login

  * Story stage updates correctly

-----

### 🚧 Known Limitations and Future Improvements

  * DB credentials stored in code due to class environment
  * No CSRF tokens (acceptable for class scope)
  * Token-based auth schema included but unused
  * Additional achievements and story chapters possible

### 🤖 AI Disclosure

AI tools were used as development assistants for debugging, architectural validation, and UI refinement.
All AI-assisted output was reviewed, tested, modified, and integrated intentionally.
No AI-generated code was used without understanding or validation.
Final functionality, structure, and testing were completed by the project authors.
